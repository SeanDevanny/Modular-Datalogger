          <h3>L5X/XML Online Datalogger</h3>
          <p>The function of this webpage is to extract data, rung comments and then graph data</p>
          <p>from Allen-Bradley PLC's custom Datalogger AOI</p>
          <p>Drag and drop your exported L5X file in the Input area below then click the upload button</p>
          <br>
          <p>When you're finished here, you may refer to the home page <a href="index.html">here</a> or via the navbar at the top of the screen</p>
          <br>
          <p>The pie chart displays sequence steps and how much of the cycle time they take up proportionately</p>
          <p>In other words, if you wish to take time off of a cycle, start with the steps that take up the largest area of the pie chart</p>
          <br>
          <p>The datalogger takes an L5X PLC file that's running the datalogger AOI and extracts the data along with related comments.</p>
          <p>Sometimes these comments don't appear. If this happens with your file, you'll need to append the file</p>
          <br>
          <h3>How to append your file</h3>
          <p>You must first get the actual tag name of the value you wish to monitor for the tags</p>
          <p>The commentless tag is likely aliased when it was fed to the datalogger AOI</p>
          <p>You should go to your PLC code and use the tag-name the datalogger provides you upon initial upload to find the actual tag name of the function monitored</p>
          <p>Trace the aliased tag back to the source to get the actual tag name</p>
          <br>
          <p>Now you have the actual tag name you're going to want to append the document</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, ensure the file input box reads something like "Uploaded file is FileName.L5X"</p>
          <br>
          <p>Populate the first input box with the old tag name (i.e. the one that was displaying without comments)</p>
          <p>Then populate the second input box with the tag it was aliased as and hit the "append" button</p>
          <p class="disclaimer">Make sure you use the full tag name. This will not work if only a part of either tag is used</p>
